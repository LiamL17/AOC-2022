# Description
This project contains the solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) challenge.

## About
Each days' solution will be completed in Kotlin and compiled with Gradle.

## Making it interesting
Alongside a Kotlin solution, another language will be used to implement the solution first. The programming languages chosen are picked randomly from the [PYPL Popularity of Programming Languages](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) list.

| 4          | Haskell taken a lot more time than expected, kotlin answer posted rather |
| 7          | Didn't give enough time and still have to do                             |
