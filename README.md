# Description
This project contains the solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/) challenge.

## About
Each days' solution will be completed in Kotlin and compiled with Gradle.

## Making it interesting
Alongside a Kotlin solution, another language will be used to implement the solution first. The programming languages chosen are picked randomly from the [PYPL Popularity of Programming Languages](https://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) list.
